Constant Time Complexity

Problem Statement: Write a function that returns the first element of an array.
Input: [5, 10, 15]
Output: 5
Logarithmic Time Complexity

Problem Statement: Implement a function that takes a number n runs as number of times as logarithimic value of n to the base 2.
Input 1: n = 100,
Output 1: 7
Input 2: n=1000
Output 2: 10
Linear Time Complexity

Problem Statement: Write a function that finds the maximum value in an array.
Input: [4, 1, 7, 2, 9]
Output: 9
Linear Time Complexity

Problem Statement: Write a function that counts the number of even numbers in an array.
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 2
Quadratic Time Complexity

Problem Statement: Write a function that finds all pairs of elements in an array whose sum is equal to a given value.
Input 1: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 6
Output 1: [(1, 5), (2, 4)]
Input 2: arr = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1], target = -2
Output 2: [(-3, 1), (-1, -1)]
Cubic Time Complexity

Problem Statement: Write a function that performs a triply nested iteration over an array and prints each combination.
Input: [1, 2, 3]
Output: [(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 3), ...]
Exponential Time Complexity

Problem Statement: Implement a recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number.
Input 1: n = 5
Output 1: 5
Input 2: n = 6
Output 2: 8
Space Complexity (Linear)

Problem Statement: Write a function that duplicates every element in an array and returns the new array.
Input: [1, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
